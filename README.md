# Actix_with-Rhai_script
This server is built using the Actix Web framework in Rust and integrates the Rhai scripting engine. It provides two endpoints, /multiply and /add, where the actual mathematical operations are performed using Rhai scripts. The scripts are loaded from files (multiply.rhai and add.rhai), allowing for dynamic and customizable behavior.
